# Cassification of Correlation Patterns

###In short



###Description
Program to evaluate the correlation patterns of a three-component ultracold system consisting of two bosonic and one fermionic species (A, B, C) interacting with gAB, gAC, gBC, gBB, gCC.

The correlation function which should be analyzed correspond to the two-body correlation between two particles resolved on a grid.

- Size of the images: 400 x 400  (we have employed 300 grid points)
- Various interspecies interaction strengths are varied: gAB, gAC, gBC, gBB, gCC.

### Aim:

- We are interested in training a model that can reproduce the expected correlation pattern when passing interaction parameters which have not been probed.
- Find features of correlation patterns and check whether they form clusters.


### Steps:

- First gather data and make the files accessible.



### File content

- *gather_ext_data.py*: script which creates and collects correlation functions
